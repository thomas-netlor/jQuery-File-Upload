# The following directives force the Content-Type
# "application/octet-stream" for all files except images.
# This prevents executing any uploaded scripts
# and forces a download dialog for non-image files:
ForceType application/octet-stream
<FilesMatch "(?i)\.(gif|jpe?g|png)$">
  ForceType none
</FilesMatch>

# The following directive prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing the content-type.
# This is an important complement to the ForceType directive above:
Header set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff

# Uncomment the following lines to prevent unauthorized download of files:
#AuthName "Authorization required"
#AuthType Basic
#require valid-user
